Below is a lightweight bench-bench plan that mobile teams often use when they want a _quick-but-repeatable_ comparison between Apple’s own Camera app and two popular React-Native options (Expo Camera and react-native-vision-camera). Everything can be done on-device with nothing more exotic than Xcode Instruments and a few open-source JS utilities.

## 1 Define the metrics up-front

| Category                                                  | How to capture it (quick way)                                                                                                                                                                        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold-start latency** (app-launch → first preview frame) | add `console.time('launch')` at component mount and stop when `onInitialized`/`useCameraDevice(...)` returns; in XCTest use `measure(metrics:)` to log the same.                                     | VisionCamera is engineered to be “as fast as a native camera app, and sometimes even faster” ([react-native-vision-camera.com][1])                                                  |
| **Shutter-to-file time** (“shutter lag”)                  | wrap `takePictureAsync` (Expo) or `takePhoto` (VisionCamera) in `performance.now()`; for the built-in Camera use XCUITest to press the shutter and watch for the file appearing in `PHPhotoLibrary`. | VisionCamera also has `takeSnapshot` which can finish in \~16 ms when you only need a preview-quality shot ([react-native-vision-camera.com][2])                                    |
| **Throughput** (burst rate)                               | run a loop of N photos, measure total seconds, derive photos/sec.                                                                                                                                    | skip for Expo if you’re in managed workflow—file I/O can bottleneck.                                                                                                                |
| **Output** • resolution • file-size • compression         | read `width/height` and file URI returned by each library; use `expo-file-system`/`react-native-fs` to call `stat` for byte size.                                                                    | VisionCamera’s `PhotoFile` object exposes width/height directly ([react-native-vision-camera.com][3]); Expo returns the same fields in `CameraCapturedPicture` ([docs.expo.dev][4]) |
| **Visual fidelity**                                       | quickest objective check: run an off-device script (e.g. `sharp`, `opencv`, `scikit-image`) that computes SSIM/PSNR between each library’s shot and the Apple-Camera reference taken from a tripod.  | Be aware: Apple’s Camera uses multi-frame fusion (Smart HDR, Deep Fusion) that third-party APIs can’t tap into ([developer.apple.com][5]), so expect it to win in low light.        |

_(If you only need a sanity-check for size & timing, you can skip SSIM/PSNR and rely on eyeballing and the EXIF stats.)_

## 2 Spin up a single “toggle” test-bed app

1. **Create a bare React-Native or Expo (Dev Client) project.**
2. Put all three capture options behind a simple picker:

```tsx
enum Engine {
  Native,
  ExpoCamera,
  VisionCamera,
}

// …UI radio buttons map to state.captureEngine
```

3. **Native path:** present a `UIImagePickerController` (or use iOS 17+ `PHPicker` with `cameraCaptureMode = .photo`).
4. **Expo path:** mount `<Camera>` from `expo-camera`; call `takePictureAsync({ quality: 1, skipProcessing: false })` to get full quality (quality slider documented in Expo docs) ([stackoverflow.com][6]).
5. **VisionCamera path:** mount `<Camera>` (from `react-native-vision-camera`) + call

```ts
camera.current?.takePhoto({
  photoCodec: "hevc",
  qualityPrioritization: "quality", // or 'speed'
});
```

6. Add the tiny timing helpers (`performance.now()`) and a `useEffect` that writes the numbers into a Redux/Context store so they appear in a results screen.

---

## 3 Run the tests

- **Hardware:** pick one iPhone model and lock exposure, focus, and lighting (tripod + constant light) so scene variability doesn’t swamp the numbers.
- **Cold start:** kill app between runs (`xcrun simctl terminate`).
- **Warm start / shutter lag:** keep app in foreground, reset counters, tap the shutter N times.
- **File analysis:** pull the generated images with `npx expo export --output-dir` (or `adb pull`/Xcode Devices panel on device) and feed them through your favourite CLI:

```bash
exiftool *.HEIC | egrep 'File Name|Image Size|File Size'
```

## 4 Typical results & what they mean

| Engine            | Launch (cold)    | Shutter lag                                               | Avg file size                                           | Comments                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Native Camera** | 0 s (system app) | ★ fastest, benefits from ISP fusion                       | ≈ 2–4 MB HEIC                                           | Deep Fusion/Smart HDR means largest dynamic range.                                  |
| **VisionCamera**  | 0.6–1.0 s        | very close to native when `qualityPrioritization:'speed'` | 1.5–3 MB (HEIC/JPEG)                                    | Snapshot mode is ultra-fast but lower quality.                                      |
| **Expo Camera**   | 2–3 s (managed)  | noticeably slower; extra 200–400 ms write time            | 1–2 MB JPEG by default, adjustable via `quality` option | Great for prototypes; heavy shutter-lag can be mitigated by `skipProcessing: true`. |

_(Numbers above are realistic on an iPhone 15 running iOS 18; they’ll vary by model.)_

## 5 Why the native app will still look better in edge cases

Apple’s Camera pipeline can fuse up to nine frames and run ML denoising before saving, techniques exposed only through high-level APIs and private frameworks. Third-party libs that sit on `AVCapturePhotoOutput` can’t invoke those algorithms, so low-light and high-dynamic-range scenes usually favour the built-in camera ([developer.apple.com][5]).

---

## 6 Take-aways / “easy-path” checklist

1. **Use VisionCamera if you need speed plus manual control** (and you’re comfortable with native pods).
2. **Use Expo Camera if you’re in a pure Expo workflow** and launch/shutter timing isn’t mission-critical.
3. **Don’t compare HEIC from Apple Camera with low-quality JPEG from a library**—align codecs (`photoCodec:'hevc'`) and quality flags first.
4. **Log everything with signposts** so your numbers show up in Instruments without extra work.
5. **Keep the scene static and lit**; otherwise your SSIM/PSNR graphs won’t mean much.

With that single toggle app and a half-hour of data collection you’ll have a head-to-head spreadsheet that answers “quality, size, and speed” far more objectively than anecdotal blog posts—yet it’s still small enough to live right inside your repo and CI for regression tests later on.
